# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer, a ride sharing company, has requested an analysis of their fares by type of location (urban, suburban, rural).

##Overview
The data request is divided into two parts.

###Part One
1. Calculate the number of rides, drivers, and total fares by location type.
2. Calcualte the average fare per ride by location type.
3. Calculate the average fare per driver by location type.
4. Create and format a dataframe to hold the dat from points 1-4.

###Part Two
1. Create a dataframe in which the sum of fares, day to day, is divided by location type.
2. Create a dataframe that displays the sum of fares, week to week, from January 1, 2019 to April 4, 2019, is divide by location type.
3. Create and format a line graph that shows the total fare by city type from the previous point.

##Results
The results of the two parts of the data request are as follows:

###Part One
The followong displays the results of the first part of the analysis.

###Overall Results
Unsuprsingly ride sharing is more frequent in areas with greater population. Howwever rides are shorter and as a result bring in lower fares. Despite this urban areas
bring in the makority of the total fares, often more than suburban and rural regions combined. Week to week fare collection within regions does not appear to varry greatly
in the first four months of 2019, althouth it is notable there was on week in late February that all three regions peaked at the same time.

##Summary
Recommendations for future business practices are difficult do to imcomplete data. As such I wwill provide three areas in which to focus on future analyses.
1. Collect data on populations of the regions and conduct a per capita analyses of ride counts to identify areas for growth.
2. Collect data on hours riders were working and conduct an analyses on productivity of drivers regarding number of rides and fare sums to identify high performance drivers and where they are located.
3. Analyze rides by time of day (e.g. morning, evening, night) and region type to focus recruoiting of drivers on those available to work in high traffic times based on region type or underserved times.
